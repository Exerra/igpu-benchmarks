# Intel UHD 620 Graphics

These benchmarks were collected on a computer with an Intel i5 (8th gen), Intel UHD 620 Graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 1080p@75Hz monitor.

## Settings

The game does not provide a lot of settings (notably resolution), but the few that it does have are set to lowest and VSync was turned off.

## Performance

The game runs on average 5 FPS (can be increased by like 2-3 frames if playing on 30 fov), and when zoomed in with a magnifying scope it goes to around 12 FPS and feels smooth-ish. If we look at the minimum system requirements, we start to see why this is the case. A NVIDIA Geforce GTX 760 outperforms the Intel UHD 620 often times by 400%, so it makes sense why this game is unplayable on integrated graphics.

### Summary

Average FPS: ~5 FPS
Average FPS while aiming down magnifying sights: ~12FPS
