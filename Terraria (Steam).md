**VRAM**: 128MB

# Intel UHD 620 Graphics

These benchmarks were collected on a computer with an Intel i5 (8th gen), Intel UHD 620 Graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 1080p@75Hz monitor.

## Settings

The graphics settings are set to highest.

Video settings are set to 1920x1080 resolution, frame skip turned off and borderless mode.

## Performance

As this is an 11-year-old (as of writing) 2D sandbox, this game performs really well. In my experience Terraria runs perfectly smooth with max FPS allowed by VSync.

### Summary

Average FPS: VSync max (tested: ~75 FPS)
