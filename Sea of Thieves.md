# Brief

On 900p and lowest settings the game runs at around 20-30fps and sometimes stutters.

# Minimum requirements

**OS**: Windows 10 Anniversary

**CPU**: Intel Q9450 @2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom II X6 @ 3.3 GHz

**RAM**: 4GB

**VRAM**: 1GB

**GPU**: Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 or AMD Radeon 7750

**DirectX**: 11

# Intel UHD 620 Graphics

These benchmarks were collected on a computer with an Intel i5 (8th gen), Intel UHD 620 Graphics, and 8GB of RAM.

## Settings

The graphics settings are set to Cursed (Lowest setting) & extra effects such as rats and screen shake is also disabled.

Video settings are set to 900p resolution, without VSync, Fullscreen mode (Windows full-screen optimisation does help, so don't turn it off).

## Performance

In content-rich areas such as Outposts (where you spawn) the game stutters and the average FPS is ~15.

While sailing the seas (which is what you will probably be doing the most) the game can feel quite smooth and is on average ~30 FPS, though it does drop and stutter a bit when you approach & load an island.

A key aspect of this game is naval combat. Maneuvering the ship and firing cannons will be enjoyable, but in PvP, you may have stutters and lose the fight.

### Summary

**Average FPS while sailing**: ~30 FPS

**Average FPS on an outpost**: ~15 FPS

## Possible optimisations

These tests were run while having Discord in the background as this is a very social game where you most likely are going to be in a call. If you are sailing by yourself, you may experience slightly better FPS and slightly less stuttering.
